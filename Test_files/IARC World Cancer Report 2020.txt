Foreword
Cancer is the second most common cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018.

At the United Nations General Assembly in 2018, world leaders agreed to take responsibility for preventing and 
treating cancer and other noncommunicable diseases, including fiscal measures to protect people from cancer-
causing products, to promote evidence-based treatment, and to work towards universal health coverage.

We have no time to lose. The cancer burden is rising globally – but not equally. The greatest impact of cancer and 
the fastest increase in the cancer burden over the coming decades is projected to be in low- and middle-income 
countries, many of which already face difficulties coping with the current burden. There are massive social in-
equalities in cancer, with large variations in incidence, survival, and mortality between social groups.

We have learned that many cancer cases can be prevented, and even when prevention is not possible, early 
diagnosis saves lives. By using evidence-based and feasible interventions and adapting them to low- and middle-
income countries where most new cancer cases will occur, a large proportion of those cases can be prevented. 
There is much that can be done to reduce social inequalities in cancer globally.

Robust, independent scientific evidence is critical, focused on the scale and patterns of cancer and its causes, pre-
vention, and early detection. The high-quality research produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC), working with researchers around the world, is essential for the development of evidence-based guidelines 
and policy by WHO, and for regulatory decisions by national institutions to protect the health of their populations.

This new IARC World Cancer Report presents the most comprehensive, up-to-date science on cancer preven-
tion, including statistics, causes, and mechanisms, and how this can be used to implement effective, resource-
appropriate strategies for cancer prevention and early detection. It also includes examples of successful preven-
tion strategies. This book is a useful reference for researchers, cancer professionals, public health workers, and 
policy-makers.

The 2017 World Health Assembly requested WHO, in collaboration with IARC, to provide a global perspective 
on all measures that are recognized to limit the burden of cancer. The outcome of this charge – the WHO Report 
on Cancer: Setting priorities, investing wisely and providing care for all – complements the IARC World Cancer 
Report by synthesizing evidence to translate the latest knowledge into actionable policies to support govern-
ments. These two publications provide a solid foundation for effective cancer policies, and bring us closer to our 
goal of changing the trajectory of cancer for communities around the world.

Preface
The objective of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is to promote international collaboration 
in cancer research. The Agency is interdisciplinary, bringing together skills in epidemiology, laboratory sciences, 
and biostatistics to identify the causes of cancer so that preventive measures may be adopted and the burden of 
disease and associated suffering reduced. A significant feature of IARC is its expertise in coordinating research 
across countries and organizations; its independent role as an international organization facilitates this activity. 
As part of its wide dissemination of information about cancer, the Agency produces World Cancer Report.

The previous World Cancer Report, published in 2014, identified a foreseeable increase in the global burden of 
cancer, with a particularly heavy burden projected to fall on low- and middle-income countries. This new World 
Cancer Report is focused on the only consideration that will credibly decrease that burden: prevention. This vol-
ume addresses cancer research for cancer prevention.

IARC routinely coordinates specialist assessments in which multiple individual research studies – typically 
hundreds or thousands of articles – are assessed by international groups of expert scientists. The results are 
published as volumes of publications series, and each series is widely recognized as providing authoritative 
determinations. These series include the IARC Monographs on the Identification of Carcinogenic Hazards to 
Humans, which address the causes of cancer; the volumes of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, which present 
population-based data on cancer occurrence; the IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention, which evaluate cancer 
prevention strategies; and the WHO Classification of Tumours series (also known as the WHO Blue Books), for 
the histological and genetic classification of human tumours. Typically, a particular volume in each of these series 
is focused on some aspect of cancer causation, prevention, pathology, and so on. This approach is not amenable 
to the provision of broad perspectives.

For broad perspectives, World Cancer Report is the relevant publication. World Cancer Report is not a digest 
of assessments made by IARC or any other authority. World Cancer Report is based on purpose-made assess-
ments, prepared by recognized investigators worldwide and published after undergoing peer review.

A broad perspective – and, where possible, a “bottom line” – is crucial in several respects. First, it ensures that all 
relevant findings are taken into account. For example, for ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, evidence of tissue injury 
from low-level exposure must be considered together with known biological benefits, including production of vita-
min D. Second, although knowledge of biological mechanisms provides valuable insights, it may not necessarily 
account for human circumstances. For example, in preventing exposures to known human carcinogens, inequal-
ities between populations may contribute to marked variations in health outcomes. Third, although investigative 
design may be constrained to parameters that can be readily determined, human behaviour is never restricted in 
such a way. For example, the incidence of obesity-related cancers is critically affected by dietary composition, 
physical activity, and sedentary practices, because these vary between communities. Finally, factors that influ-
ence cancer causation and prevention may have markedly different outcomes when implemented across com-
munities or countries that differ environmentally, sociologically, climatically, and economically.

x



IARC is uniquely placed to encompass a broad spectrum of knowledge while presenting the results in manage-
able terms. The production of World Cancer Report is achieved by engaging the Agency’s scientific staff to col-
laborate in the development of the publication at every level. This includes ensuring that the planned contents 
address all relevant knowledge; identifying distinguished authors and reviewers from across the globe; ensuring 
that differing perspectives are offered in a balanced, evidence-based manner; and considering circumstances 
that my restrict implementation of cancer-preventive interventions.

Cancer can be prevented by avoiding exposure to a known carcinogen. However, this fundamental concept can-
not always encompass why different tumour types are particularly prevalent in some populations and not others, 
or how genomics and related technologies may reveal individual susceptibility and new methods of early diagno-
sis. Nor can a simplistic understanding of cancer prevention explain why health service-related and other inequal-
ities differentially determine the degree of success of preventive initiatives in different communities. Smoking 
cessation remains the most widely established means of cancer prevention, and new insights are offered in this 
World Cancer Report. However, efforts to reduce the burden of cancer cover a broad range, from contending 
with tumour types that essentially have no known causative agents all the way through to the prospect of cervical 
cancer being eliminated by the use of vaccines, which have been developed because of research on particular 
cancer-causing viruses.

Accordingly, this new World Cancer Report provides investigators with detailed information across a multidisci-
plinary spectrum. Equally, World Cancer Report provides people in the wider community, no matter where they 
are located worldwide, with insights into how the cancer types that have for so long affected their communities 
may now have a lesser impact than was previously thought.

Introduction
World Cancer Report is an initiative of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and is published 
about every 5 years. Since the inception of World Cancer Report, in 2003, the editorial policy has been to provide 
a concise, multidisciplinary assessment of current research, made as accessible as possible through a high il-
lustrative content and a minimum of scientific jargon. For every chapter included, authority is achieved in the first 
instance by engaging experts worldwide, who then face the challenge of presenting information covering broad 
fields in a few thousand words. All chapters are subject to peer review.

The scope of this World Cancer Report
The breadth of knowledge addressed in each World Cancer Report has varied to meet the needs of the time. In 
2003, when the availability of concise overviews across all aspects of cancer causation, prevention, and treat-
ment in a single volume was unprecedented, a comprehensive approach was taken. Although a section on can-
cer treatment was included in the first World Cancer Report, since then there has been an explosive increase in 
research on precision therapy, and coverage of this proved to be impracticable if World Cancer Report were to 
remain of manageable size. The fact that World Cancer Report is concise is a central consideration and one that 
readers collectively value. This may be one reason why World Cancer Report 2014 has been downloaded more 
than 35 000 times.

As explained in the Preface, this World Cancer Report is focused on cancer research for cancer prevention. This 
focus has necessitated the inclusion of a new section, so that the scope of available research can be adequately 
recognized: a section on inequalities that affect cancer prevention. This section has not appeared in any previous 
World Cancer Report.

Section 4, on inequalities that affect cancer prevention, is the antithesis of, for example, Section 3, on biological 
processes in cancer development. The chapters in Section 3 concern human biology, largely without reference 
to geography or community, whereas the chapters that discuss inequalities must involve references to particular 
communities and their circumstances. The need to address what is particular to various communities also under-
pins the content of Section 1, about the global cancer burden.

Another first for this World Cancer Report is the inclusion of a chapter on sporadic cancer. On the basis of current 
research, an attainable reduction in the incidence of cancer worldwide depends primarily on reducing exposure 
to known carcinogens. However, currently available research on several cancer types, including prostate cancer, 
brain cancer, and leukaemias, does not allow a clear proportion of these malignancies to be attributed to particu-
lar exogenous factors. So, in such cases, is the development of sporadic cancer due to “bad luck”, and is preven-
tion no longer a consideration? Not at all! Indeed, in such situations particularly, genomics and other technologies 
are key to further investigations of etiology and to delivering new or improved procedures for early diagnosis and 
screening; these matters are covered in Section 6.

What information is provided in World Cancer Report?
World Cancer Report is designed to provide cancer researchers, health-care professionals, regulators, and pol-
icy-makers with current findings about the causes of cancer, its prevention, and other matters tending to reduce 
the burden of cancer. In particular, this volume provides insights into fields of investigation that may be adjacent 
to those with which a particular reader may be familiar. Broader professional engagement with cancer control and 
a need for information by journalists, governments, and community-based cancer-oriented authorities and the 
teaching profession is also recognized.

As cancer research scientists, we, the editors of this World Cancer Report, readily acknowledge the need to pro-
vide information about cancer causes and prevention to the wider community with as few barriers as are compat-
ible with an accurate understanding. In the past, such a commitment to immediate comprehension has involved 
providing explanations for technical terms and/or including a glossary. We have not adopted such options, for 
several reasons: to avoid interrupting the flow of information, because most of the text is immediately accessible, 
and considering that search engines are available to provide access to specifics.

In providing insight to those who are not necessarily undertaking research in a particular field, some background 
information must be specified. This is an important but secondary consideration. Indeed, this World Cancer Report 
is not intended to be a textbook that provides a comprehensive overview of well-established key knowledge. 
Therefore, given the overall constraints on length, the authors of each chapter have provided a separate set of state-
ments covering the Fundamentals (presented in a shaded sidebar). The information provided in the Fundamentals 
is axiomatic to the field of research covered in the chapter, but, unlike the points given in the chapter’s Summary, is 
not necessarily addressed in the main text of the chapter.

To meet the immediate needs of professionals for contemporary data, the authors of each chapter were asked 
to focus on research results achieved during the past 5 years. This determinant of content is not the same as 
summarizing current knowledge. For example, the chapters in Section 2, on the causes of cancer, are not neces-
sarily comprehensive. Tobacco smoking continues to be the major preventable cause of death from cancer, and 
indeed from multiple other diseases, but this long-held knowledge does not, in our view, require reiteration at the 
expense of describing the latest research findings, including the latest approaches to smoking cessation.

A feature of this volume, as in all previous World Cancer Reports, is that the largest single section (Section 5) is 
that devoted to particular cancer types: 20 chapters. In numerical terms, 20 is small compared with the hundreds 
of tumour types as documented in the WHO Classification of Tumours series (also known as the WHO Blue 
Books; http://whobluebooks.iarc.fr). However, the 20 types of cancer that are covered here, when taken together, 
account for the overwhelming majority of cancer cases worldwide and, of greater importance, account for almost 
all initiatives aimed at cancer prevention.

World Cancer Report xiii



The volumes of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (http://ci5.iarc.fr/) and the associated GLOBOCAN data-
base document data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and trends for multiple cancer types across hundreds 
of communities. These findings are summarized and made readily accessible online through the IARC Global 
Cancer Observatory (https://gco.iarc.fr). Therefore, the epidemiological information in chapters in Section 5 is 
not documented systematically. Rather, authors were invited to give priority to recent epidemiological findings 
that have contributed to an increased understanding of etiology or, in some rare cases, prevention. As a result, 
there are marked differences between the chapters with respect to the amount of epidemiological data presented. 
Similarly, information about exogenous causes or population-based screening varies markedly between cancer 
types, from comprehensive data to nothing relevant, and such circumstances account in large part for differences 
between chapters in Section 5.

Where to from here?
All the research described in this World Cancer Report is calculated, directly or indirectly, to reduce the burden 
of cancer, whether globally or in particular communities or for certain categories of people at risk. Typically, such 
outcomes occur as a result of the adoption of certain policies, either by governments or by other competent au-
thorities. Then, many cancer-preventive options depend on individual decision-making and commitment. All such 
matters are themselves amenable to research.

There is no generally operative procedure that determines the transition from cancer research findings to cancer 
prevention policies. When such a pathway is charted for a particular innovation, the ease of its implementation will 
be determined by many factors as they operate in particular countries or communities. In this context, World Cancer 
Report is not designed as a vehicle for advocacy: research needs are not listed as such, nor are priorities specified.

The key role of cancer research in cancer prevention, as a record of achievement, is clear and unequivocal on 
a global scale. Since the publication of World Cancer Report 2014, the burden of cancer attributable to obesity 
and – separately – to pollution has been made clearer than ever before. More immediately in terms of the ultimate 
goal of prevention, there is global progress in reducing tobacco-attributable cancers, at least in some countries. 
And where once there was the goal of increased screening for cervical cancer, there is now, through vaccination, 
the prospect of eliminating cervical cancer as a public health concern.

In short, “cancer research for cancer prevention” is not simply a way to describe a particular field of investigation. 
Far more importantly, these words identify a pathway that may materially reduce the acknowledged burden of 
cancer faced by humanity. There is, in fact, no other way.

1 The global  
cancer burden 

As far as we know, cancer has always afflicted to high-income countries, has long been rec-
humans, although for centuries its relative im- ognized as a global scourge. Previously, low-
pact was overshadowed by early death from income countries primarily had a relatively 
infectious diseases. Until recently, informa- high incidence of stomach, liver, and cervical 
tion on the global distribution of cancer was cancer, but changes in incidence over time 
limited for certain communities and countries. for these and other cancer types illustrate 
We now have a reasonable basis for estimat- variation between countries. Finally, there are 
ing the global cancer burden. For several tu- marked differences between countries or re-
mour types – colorectal, prostate, and breast gions in cancer mortality, with an increasing

realization of Target 3.4, a set of 
health targets have been proposed 
to reduce the exposure to risk fac-

prevention and treatment of NCDs. 
A subsequent reduction in prema-
ture deaths from NCDs would have 
a profound effect on population lon-
gevity and an economic impact (see 
Chapter 6.9).

the two groups of countries. For 
some cancer types, such as breast 
cancer and ovarian cancer, the mor-
tality burden was greater in countries 
with low or medium HDI, although the 
incidence rates in those countries 
were lower than the rates in coun-
tries with high or very high HDI. The 
proportionately higher case fatalities 
in countries with low or medium HDI 
relates to the poorer survival pros-
pects after diagnosis on average, for 
reasons that include a lack of access 
to timely diagnosis and treatment. 
For example, when the mortality-to-
incidence ratio is used as a proxy of 
survival, the case fatality for breast 
cancer is 48% in countries with low 
or medium HDI, 4 times that in coun-
tries with high or very high HDI.

Cancer profile by HDI 
level in 2018
Cancer profiles by HDI level differ 
when assessed by incidence, mor-
tality, and 5-year prevalence.

In women, the five major can-
cer types accounted for more than 
50% of the burden in each of these 
three indicators (Fig. 1.3.4). Uniquely, 
breast cancer was the most com-
mon cancer type across all HDI tiers 
in terms of incidence, followed by 
cervical cancer in the low and me-
dium HDI tiers and colorectal cancer 
in the high and very high HDI tiers.

Cervical cancer was the most 
common cause of cancer mortality 
in the low HDI tier and the second 
most common in the medium HDI 
tier, highlighting a residual burden of 
infection-related cancers in countries

Conclusions
Despite inherent diversity in the can-
cer burden within a given HDI level, 
HDI provides a useful framework 
to map out continuing transitions in 
cancer incidence, risk factors, and 
outcomes. In particular, HDI serves 
as an exploratory tool to monitor 
shifts in the profile of cancer types, 
as clearly demonstrated by the dis-
placement of infection-related can-
cers by cancers associated with be-
haviours and lifestyles that are more 
typical of industrialized societies, 
and with increasing societal and 
economic development.

Although the cancer incidence 
burden is currently highest in coun-
tries with very high HDI, the pre-
dicted increases in the cancer bur-
den will have the greatest impacts 
on countries with low and medium 
HDI. Because cancer outcomes 
are already poorer in countries in 
transition, appropriate scaling up 
of resources for effective strategies 
in primary and secondary preven-
tion in these countries is critical to 
effectively control the prevalence 
of adverse lifestyle factors, to ulti-
mately reduce the cancer burden.

cerns. Although these products gen-

Cigarettes
Cigarette smoke contains more 
than 8000 compounds, includ-

Certain carcinogens are thought to 
be particularly important, includ-
ing tobacco-specific nitrosamines,

and aromatic amines. The molecu-

Human papillomaviruses
Thirteen sexually transmitted mu-
cosal HPV subtypes have been clas-
sified as carcinogenic to humans. 
Together, they are responsible for 
all cervical cancer cases globally 
(570 000 cases) and a variable pro-
portion of cases of other anogenital 
and oropharyngeal cancers (totalling 
120 000 cases) [2]. The most affect-
ed region of the world is sub-Saha-
ran Africa, where about 60% of all in-
fection-associated cancer cases are 
caused by HPV (see Chapter 5.10).

In every world region, two sub-
types, HPV16 and HPV18, are re-
sponsible for about 70% of cervical 
cancer cases. HPVs are responsi-
ble for more than half of all infec-
tion-associated cancers in women

been shown to have a big impact 
in decreasing HPV prevalence and 
persistence and rates of cervical in-
traepithelial neoplasia (a precursor 
of cervical cancer) [11]. The quad-
rivalent and nonavalent vaccines are 
also highly effective at preventing 
anogenital warts, caused by HPV6 
and HPV11.

Although there has been con-
siderable progress in the deploy-
ment of HPV vaccination, many 
years will need to go by before the 
impact on cancer will be fully evi-
dent (see Chapter 6.3). Therefore, 
cervical screening programmes, in 
particular using HPV-based point-
of-care testing where available, will

disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (bottom) in 2016, by age group.
5.3% of all deaths [11]. A large pro-
portion of the health burden caused 
by alcohol consumption stems from 
cancer. In 2016, alcohol caused an 
estimated 376 200 (95% uncertainty 
interval, 324 900–439 700) cancer 
deaths, representing 4.2% (95% un-
certainty interval, 3.6–4.9%) of all 
cancer deaths, and an age-stand-
ardized rate (ASR) of 4.8 deaths 
(95% confidence interval, 4.2–5.7) 
per 100 000 people (Table  2.3.1). 
Here, the term “alcohol-attributable 
cancers” is used to refer to cancers 
caused by alcohol. The proportion of 
alcohol-attributable cancers is thus 
defined by the proportion of cancers 
that would not have occurred if there 
had been no alcohol exposure (for 
definitions of causality, see [12]; for al-
cohol-attributable fractions, see [13]).

Of the 245  million disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in 
2016 due to cancer, 10.3  million 
(95% uncertainty interval, 8.7  mil-
lion–12.0  million) were due to alco-
hol consumption, representing 4.2% 
(95% uncertainty interval, 3.6–4.9%) 
of all cancer DALYs lost (Table 2.3.2). 
The majority (97.7%) of these alco-
hol-attributable cancer DALYs lost 
were due to years of life lost because 
of premature death resulting from 
high cancer fatality rates.

In 2016, cancers of the colorec-
tum, liver, and oesophagus were 
the largest contributors to the al-
cohol-attributable cancer burden, 
responsible for 23.9%, 22.3%, and

the total number of cancer deaths 
worldwide increased from 8.1  mil-
lion in 2010 to 9.0  million in 2016 
[11]. However, the ASR of cancer 
mortality decreased by 6.0% (from 
122.4 per 100 000 in 2010 to 115.0 
per 100 000 in 2016), less than the 
9.0% decrease in the ASR of overall 
mortality (from 791.3 per 100 000 in 
2010 to 720.1 per 100 000 in 2016).

The ASRs of alcohol-attributable 
mortality decreased less than over-
all cancer mortality rates in gen-
eral (by 4.8%, from 5.1 deaths per 
100  000 in 2010 to 4.8 deaths per 
100 000 in 2016), resulting in an in-
crease of 1.5% in the proportion of 
cancer deaths attributable to alcohol 
consumption (from 4.1% in 2010 to 
4.2% in 2016). Thus, the relative im-
pact of alcohol on cancer mortality 
increased slightly from 2010 to 2016.

Trends in the ASRs of alcohol-
attributable cancer mortality and in 
the proportion of cancers attributa-
ble to alcohol consumption showed 
heterogeneous patterns by cancer 
site. In particular, the ASR of mortal-
ity due to cancers of the lip and oral 
cavity was the only ASR to increase 
(from 2.1 deaths per 100 000 in 2010 
to 2.2 deaths per 100 000 in 2016), 
and the ASR of mortality due to oe-
sophageal cancer (see Chapter 5.3) 
decreased the most (from 6.2 deaths 
per 100 000 in 2010 to 5.5 deaths per 
100 000 in 2016).

In the long term, increases in the 
economic wealth of countries are 
likely to lead to further increases in 
life expectancies, resulting in higher 
incidence of and mortality from can-
cer and a concomitant higher rela-
tive importance of cancer as a cause

people (bottom) in 2016, by level of Human Development Index (HDI). programmes designed to reduce 

alcohol consumption in the general 
population are an effective and cost-
effective means of targeting and im-
proving cancer control (see Chapter 
6.1). The observed differences be-
tween countries and regions in alco-
hol-attributable fractions of cancer 
deaths and cancer DALYs lost pro-
vide an evidence base for how to re-
duce this burden through individual-
level and societal-level programmes 
that reduce alcohol consumption, 
such as the WHO intervention strat-
egies known as alcohol policy “best 
buys”, which include increasing 
excise taxation of alcoholic bever-
ages, restricting access to retailed 
alcoholic beverages, and limiting 
advertising and promotion of alco-
holic products [24]. 

Furthermore, the burden of alco-
hol-attributable cancers could be re-
duced through measures that target 
those risk factors that interact with 
alcohol consumption to increase the 
risk of cancer or that directly affect the 
risk of alcohol-related cancers, such 
as tobacco smoking (see “Tobacco 
cessation: the WHO perspective”). 
In addition, early recognition of the 
signs and symptoms of cancer, as 
well as prompt diagnosis of precan-
cerous lesions and tumours, are in 
many cases vital to patient survival, 
and therefore screening for colorec-
tal cancer and breast cancer may 
also reduce the burden of alcohol-
attributable cancers [25].

Fig. 2.4.3. Incidence of skin cancers in Japan in 1975–2010 in different age groups. Epidemiology of skin 
cancers
The incidence of both melanoma 
and non-melanoma skin cancers 
is increasing worldwide, not only 
in White populations [5] but also in 
Asian populations. In addition, there 
is marked variation in incidence by 
geographical location between and 
within countries. Epidemiological 
studies have demonstrated a nega-
tive correlation between the latitude 
of residence and the incidence and 
mortality rates of melanoma and non-
melanoma skin cancers in homoge-
neous populations.

According to statistics from 
the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare of Japan, the incidence of 
skin cancers in Japan has increased 
dramatically over the past decades, 
especially in people older than 
65 years (Fig. 2.4.3). A longer life ex-

Earlier studies, mainly those using 
mouse models, have provided an 
explanation for this paradox by dem-
onstrating that UV radiation not only 
transforms cells by inducing muta-
tions but also interferes with host 
immunity against the developing 
skin tumours. These studies dem-
onstrated that UV irradiation of the 
skin produces both local immunosup-
pression, which inhibits immune func-
tions within the irradiated skin, and 
systemic immunosuppression against 
antigens introduced at a critical time 
after exposure to UV radiation.

Modulation of immune responses 
initiated at non-irradiated sites is now 
known to involve soluble mediators.

suggest that these potential biases 
should be small [4]. The European 
EPI-CT project, which includes 
more than 1  million children, will 
provide new results on cancer

More information about thy-
roid cancer risks at low doses was 
provided by a pooled analysis of 
nine cohorts of more than 100 000 
children (eight medical cohorts of 
children treated for benign and ma-
lignant diseases and the cohort of 
atomic bomb survivors). It showed 
a statistically significant linear 
dose–response relationship for thy-
roid doses of 0–100 mSv [6].

for their occupational exposure.

Other studies quantified a dose

the association between radon 
exposure and risk of lung cancer,

of exposure [7]; the results were 
consistent with those from studies 
of indoor radon. Also, an analy-

is a suitable approach to detect rel-

Given the research uncertain-
ties, precautionary measures might 
be taken. Because mobile phones 
are the most relevant exposure 
source and because the strength 
of RF-EMF decreases rapidly with 
distance from the source, the sim-
plest and most effective precaution-
ary measure is to hold the mobile 
phone away from the body during 
transmission; this will result in a 
substantial reduction in exposure.

Sedentary behaviour
Sedentary behaviour is defined as 
“any waking behaviour character-
ized by an energy expenditure less

a sitting or reclining posture” [8]. 
Sedentary behaviour comprises sit-

Obesity
Overweight and obesity are general-
ly assessed through various anthro-
pometric measures. In population 
studies of cancer, the predominant 
measures used are body mass index 
(BMI), which is obtained by dividing 
the body weight (in kilograms) by 
the square of the height (in metres), 
and waist circumference. There is

However, the studies in humans and

carcinogenicity to humans by IARC

epidemiological evidence is not suf-

Increasing attention is now be-

Estimates have been made in 
various countries, using various

cancer that may be attributable to 
occupational exposures, and that 
could potentially be prevented if 
those hazards were eliminated. 
In general, it has been estimated

Table 2.10.3. Measures to control workplace exposures to occupational carcinogens

Control method Examples of good practice

Elimination Remove the hazard from the workplace, for example change a process so that the chemicals, 
materials, or equipment are no longer required.

Substitution Replace a hazardous material or piece of equipment with a less-hazardous one.

Engineering controls Redesign the equipment or process so that the hazard is controlled at its source, for example through 
a physical barrier.

Worker education Provide information and training on all workplace carcinogens and the use of appropriate control 
methods.
Use information media (e.g. posters, leaflets, data sheets) imaginatively and strategically.

Administrative controls Design and operate effective and reliable processes and activities to minimize exposure.
Provide safe storage, handling, and transportation, and disposal facilities.

Personal protective equipment Use suitable personal protective equipment, for example gloves, coveralls, respirators, hard hats, 
safety glasses, high-visibility clothing, and safety footwear.

Investigation of cancer GWAS

Although the pace of discoveries 
from GWAS has accelerated with 
large collaborative networks, the 
investigation of each individual sus-
ceptibility locus has not advanced 
at a comparable speed; therefore, 
the ability to gain new mechanistic 
insights has lagged behind [17]. This 
is because it is necessary to con-
duct a series of studies to determine 
the variants that are actually respon-

■■ Use of oral contraceptives is 
related to long-term reduced 
risks of endometrial cancer 
and ovarian cancer, but 
does not have a generalized 
effect on breast cancer risk. 
Although use of menopausal 
hormone therapy has been 
recognized for some time as 
being related to increased 
risks of breast cancer and 
endometrial cancer, it has 
been more difficult to resolve 
how changing prescribing 
patterns (including the addition 
of progestins to estrogen 
therapy) affect risk.

■■ A variety of menstrual factors, 
including age at menarche, 
age at menopause, and type 
of menopause, appear to be 
related to risk of breast cancer, 
endometrial cancer, and 
ovarian cancer.

■■ Additional support for the 
importance of hormonal factors 
derives from findings that 
obese women are at increased 
risk of postmenopausal breast 
cancer and endometrial 
cancer, and that obesity 
can affect the influence of 
exogenous hormones.

■■ Until recently, investigations 
that have attempted to assess 
the influence of endogenous 
hormones on various cancer 
sites have been hindered by 
the limitations of assays for 
measuring hormones.

Ovarian cancer
Nulliparity is a well-recognized risk 
factor for ovarian cancer, as is in-
fertility. Although there has been 
extensive controversy about the 
potential effects of fertility drugs, 
the latest studies suggest that the 
indications for use are more im-
portant than the drugs themselves 
(see Chapter  2.11). Endometriosis 
is a well-established predictor of 
certain types of ovarian cancer, in-

Infection with human papillomavirus

other co-factors are important (see 
Chapter 5.10). Although the rela-

cervical cancer risk is controversial, 
one project that involved combining

Fig. 3.6.8. Association between risk of prostate cancer and increasing fifths of hormone concentrations, from a collaborative analysis 
of 18 prospective studies. The position of each square indicates the magnitude of the relative risk (RR), and the area of the square 
is proportional to the amount of statistical information available. The length of the horizontal line through the square indicates the 
95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-square 1 degree of freedom statistic for linear trend (χ2

1 for trend) is calculated by replacing the 
categorical variables with a continuous variable scored as 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. The P value was two-sided for statistical signif

Identification of 
unknown signals ■■ Recent applications of

Biomarkers, biological understanding are influenced by cancers, 
and some of them are causally

There is cross-talk between epigenetic and genetic changes in the process of cancer development and progression. Given that

Fig. 3.8.2. Epigenetic mechanisms and cancer: an interface between the environment and the genome. Exposures arising from 
external sources (such as environmental chemicals, air pollution, infectious agents, diet, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, 
and endocrine disrupters) and internal processes (such as metabolism, hormones, inflammation, gut microflora, and ageing) may 
induce stable and potentially reversible changes in the epigenome. The patterns (“signatures”) and persistence of these alterations 
depend on multiple factors, including the type of epigenetic changes (some genomic regions remain methylated for longer periods 
than others), the duration and dosage of the exposure (longer and more intense exposures could minimize the reversibility of DNA 
methylation), the tissue type, and the developmental stage (in utero life or puberty may be particularly sensitive periods for some 
exposures). Thus, epigenetic mechanisms may represent “sensors” of exposure and “mediators” of the outcomes, including cancer 
development. Epigenomic alterations should prove instrumental in the discovery of new biomarkers for risk stratification and early 
detection, and attractive targets for novel therapies and preventive strategies.

to environmental factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection and tobacco smoke, is known to induce aberrant DNA methylation 
of specific genes in normal-appearing tissue. Further accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation and genetic alterations will lead to 
the development of cancer, and each cancer has individual epigenetic profiles that can be associated with pathophysiology, such 
as aggressiveness, response to therapy, and prognosis. Measurement of methylation in normal-appearing tissues can be used as 
a biomarker of cancer risk. Cancer cell-specific DNA methylation can be used as a biomarker for cancer detection. Methylation of

222 Chapter 3.10 • The microbiome



Fig. 3.10.2. Environment- and host-dependent effects of the microbiota on carcinogenesis, cancer prevention, and therapy. The 
composition of the microbiota is shaped by many environmental factors, such as diet and xenobiotics (pharmaceuticals), as well as 
host factors, which include lifestyle, metabolism, the immune system, and pathophysiological conditions (e.g. cancer) that alter mu-
cosal milieus. The microbiota itself modulates many of these effects, which contributes to individual-specific cancer risk and therapy 
outcomes. Examples of such modulations are (i) gut microbial fermentation of dietary fibre into butyrate (and other short-chain fatty 
acids), which promotes epithelial health and prevents neoplastic transformation; (ii) gut microbial metabolism of primary bile acids 
into carcinogenic secondary bile acids; (iii) disruption of mucosal barriers by microbial mucus degradation and pro-inflammatory 
metabolites, which promotes cancer development; (iv) gut microbial drug metabolism and reversal of host detoxification processes; 
and (v) microbial immunostimulation. Both (iv) and (v) can affect the outcome of cancer therapy. Current knowledge of cancer-
preventing or cancer-promoting mechanisms is based on preclinical and observational studies. However, because large-scale 
cohort studies in multiple countries are now collecting faecal samples, it will soon become possible to evaluate gut microbial risk 
factors for several cancer types prospectively. Similarly, prospective follow-up studies of cancer patients will enable better definition 
of prognostic microbial biomarkers for general survival or treatment success. (For more details, see [2–5,20].)

SECTION 3
CHAPTER 3.10



Fig.  3.10.3. Molecular mechanisms by which bacteria promote carcinogenesis. Although most mechanisms remain to be 
characterized in detail, they can be broadly grouped into direct and indirect mechanisms. Bacteria can directly contribute to 
genomic instability of host cells via diffusible genotoxins such as colibactin or cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). Another means 
of directly promoting genomic instability is to interfere with host DNA damage repair (in some cases via manipulation of p53 
activity). Bacterial pathogens have further evolved a range of mechanisms that divert host signalling processes to promote cell 
survival and proliferation. As a consequence, various pro-oncogenic cellular programmes are triggered, for instance via activation of 
oncogenes and deactivation of tumour suppressors, or via disruption of cell–cell junctions, cell polarity, and epithelial barrier integrity 
(through interference with β-catenin/WNT signalling). Bacterial manipulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein, and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated 
B cells (NF-κB) pathways can result in pro-inflammatory signalling (see also Chapter 3.5). Systemic inflammation can also be 
promoted indirectly via signalling of host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) binding to microbe-associated molecular patterns, 
which include bacterial cell-wall antigens such as lipopolysaccharide. Bacteria are also capable of producing pro-inflammatory 
metabolites, such as secondary bile acids, which can act systemically when reaching the circulation. Indirect ways of triggering local 
inflammation include the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as extracellular superoxide, or the induction of the host 
spermine oxidase (SMO), an enzyme that is involved in generating hydrogen peroxide from polyamine breakdown. Finally, some 
bacteria can also elicit immunosuppressive responses, thereby indirectly contributing to tumour survival through evasion of immune 
surveillance. AvrA, avirulence A; BFT, Bacteroides fragilis toxin; CagA, cytotoxin-associated gene A; FadA, Fusobacterium adhesin

The gut microbiota is increasingly 
appreciated as a versatile “microbial

evidence is accumulating that it can

efficacy, and toxicity of various

can was reported to be metabolized 
by intestinal bacteria. This chemo-
therapeutic drug, used to treat colo-
rectal cancer, is detoxified (glucu-
ronidated) in the liver to SN-38-G. 
After SN-38-G is excreted into the 
intestine, it can be reactivated by 
bacterial β-glucuronidases, and

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation can be seen as a 
form of immunotherapy that is pri-
marily used to treat various hae-

immune disorders). Although poten-
tially curative, it is associated with 
a range of serious, life-threatening 
complications, which include graft-

Several human DNA and RNA vi-
ruses are carcinogenic to humans. 
Although oncogenic viruses belong 
to different families, their strategies 
in human cancer development show 
many similarities and involve viral-
encoded oncoproteins targeting the 
key cellular proteins that regulate 
cell growth [24]. These targets may 
include important tumour suppres-
sor genes and/or oncogenes. The 
result of these viral effects is to im-
mortalize the cells of the target tis-

Fig. 4.1.1. Age-standardized (world population) incidence and mortality rates of all cancer types, by average level of socioeconomic 
development in 2012. Socioeconomic development is measured by the education and income index (EDI), which is similar to the 
Human Development Index (HDI) but excludes life expectancy. (HDI was not appropriate for this analysis because life expectancy 
could be directly affected by cancer mortality.) EDI is calculated by taking the geometric mean of normalized indices of gross 
national income per capita and of national education level (average and expected years of schooling). EDI is a dimensionless 
variable between 0 and 1 (the higher a country’s score, the higher the level of development). Four categories of socioeconomic 
development are shown: low (EDI ≤ 0.55), medium (0.55 < EDI ≤ 0.7), high (0.7 < EDI ≤ 0.8), and very high (EDI > 0.8).

Evidence of cancer 
inequalities within 
countries
Within countries, the socioeconom-
ic gradient for cancer incidence may 
vary in magnitude and direction 
across different cancer sites, but 
cancer mortality is often higher, and 
cancer survival lower, in groups with 
low socioeconomic position and oth-
er disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic 
and racial minorities and Indigenous 
populations), for cancer overall and 
for the large majority of cancer types 
[7,12,14–17] (Fig.  4.1.2). There is a 
clear gradient of higher overall can-
cer mortality and lower cancer sur-
vival from high to low socioeconomic 
position [7], which shows that can-
cer inequalities affect (almost) the 
entire population and are not limited 
to low-income sectors of society. 
Therefore, policies and interventions 
to reduce cancer inequalities can 
be beneficial for entire populations, 
although the potential benefits are 
largest for disadvantaged groups. 

Relatively large socioeconomic 
inequalities, with much higher can-
cer incidence and mortality in groups 
with lower socioeconomic position, 
have been consistently reported, 
most markedly for smoking-related 
cancers (see Chapter 2.1), such as 
lung cancer, oral cancer, pharyn-
geal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and 
oesophageal cancer, and also for

Interventions and policies are 
likely to be more effective when 
they are based on approaches that 
combine a population strategy with 
a vulnerable-population strategy – 
an approach called proportionate 
universalism. In the case of cervical 
cancer, there is enormous potential 
to eliminate the disease, and thus 
reduce inequalities, through a com-

also to socioeconomic inequality 
[22]. The commission identified five 
dysfunctions of the global gover-
nance system that allow adverse 
effects of global political determi-
nants of health inequity to persist: 
(i)  insufficient participation in deci-
sion-making by civil society, health 
experts, and marginalized groups; 
(ii)  weak accountability mecha-
nisms; (iii)  lack of response to 
changing societal needs, enabling 
entrenchment of power dispari-
ties, with adverse effects on health 
(called “institutional stickiness” by 
the authors); (iv)  inadequate policy 
space for health; and (v)  lack of 
international institutions to protect 
and promote health [22].

■■ As the world’s most populous 

country, China accounts for 
more than 23% of new cancer 
cases, about half of the new 
cases of liver cancer, oesopha-
geal cancer, and stomach can-
cer, and about 30% of cancer 
deaths worldwide.

■■ Along with rapid economic 
development, urbanization, 
and the ageing of the 
population, the cancer burden 
and the spectrum of cancer 
types show considerable 
variation between urban and 
rural areas.

■■ China is urbanizing rapidly;  
the percentage of the 
population living in urban 
areas increased from 18% 
in 1978 to 56% in 2015 – an 
increase of 311.1% in about 
40 years – and is expected to 
reach 71% by 2030.

with rapid urbanization, including 
large-scale migration, ageing of the 
population, and pollution in both ur-
ban and rural areas (see Chapter 
2.9), have also emerged [10].

Age-standardized incidence rates 
of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, 
prostate cancer, kidney cancer, 
and bladder cancer were higher 
in urban areas than in rural areas, 
and were higher in areas with high 
gross domestic product (GDP) 
per capita and high urbanization 
[16,17]. Obesity and physical inac-
tivity, which are the leading attribu-
table risk factors for both colorec- b
tal cancer and breast cancer, are 
more prevalent in urban areas than 
in rural areas, not only in China but 
also worldwide; differences in the 
prevalence of obesity and physical 
inactivity are partly responsible for 
the rural–urban disparity in the in-
cidence of these two cancer types 
[18–20]. Changes in reproductive 
factors, such as increasing expo-
sure to xeno-estrogens and oral 
contraceptives, may also lead to a 
higher incidence of breast cancer 
in urban areas [21]. For colorectal

These substantial differences 
may result in inappropriate inter-
ventions, excessive screening, 
and overtreatment, or in delayed 
provision of appropriate treatment. 
The differences certainly result in 
a higher disease burden, a lower 
quality of life, health inequities, 
and increased costs for health and 
care systems. For example, there

b In Estonia, the population-based pilot programme started in 2016 among a cohort aged 60 years, with an intended target group of age 60–69 years.
c Ireland is planning to extend the target age range to 55–74 years.
d In Italy, large regional differences can be seen in attendance: North, 48–52%; Centre, 21–24%; South, 8%; Piedmont (FS + FIT), 17–20%.
e In Piedmont, Italy, FIT is offered to individuals aged 59–69 years if they are unwilling to undergo FS. For both FIT and FS together, the attendance is 
17–20%.

of Indigenous health is the direct 
result of past policies related to

Indigenous people are more likely

EUROPEAN CODE AGAINST CANCER      

1 2 ways to reduce your cancer risk

1 Do not smoke. Do not use any form of tobacco. 

2 Make your home smoke free. Support smoke-free policies in your workplace. 

3 Take action to be a healthy body weight. 

4 Be physically active in everyday life. Limit the time you spend sitting. 

5 Have a healthy diet: 
 Eat plenty of whole grains, pulses, vegetables and fruits. 
 Limit high-calorie foods (foods high in sugar or fat) and avoid sugary drinks. 
 Avoid processed meat; limit red meat and foods high in salt. 

6 If you drink alcohol of any type, limit your intake. Not drinking alcohol is better 
  for cancer prevention. 

7 Avoid too much sun, especially for children. Use sun protection. Do not use
 sunbeds. 

8 In the workplace, protect yourself against cancer-causing substances by following 
  health and safety instructions. 

9 Find out if you are exposed to radiation from naturally high radon levels in your 
  home. Take action to reduce high radon levels. 

10 For women: 
 Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s cancer risk. If you can, breastfeed your baby. 
 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of certain cancers.  

Limit use of HRT. 

11 Ensure your children take part in vaccination programmes for: 
 Hepatitis B (for newborns) 
 Human papillomavirus (HPV) (for girls). 

12 Take part in organized cancer screening programmes for: 
 Bowel cancer (men and women)  
 Breast cancer (women) 
 Cervical cancer (women). 

The European Code Against Cancer focuses on actions that individual citizens can take to help prevent cancer.  
Successful cancer prevention requires these individual actions to be supported by governmental policies and actions.  

Find out more about the European Code Against Cancer at: http://cancer-code-europe.iarc.fr 
This project is co-financed by the European Union and coordinated by the specialized cancer agency of the  

World Health Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

●● HPV-related oropharyngeal 
cancers differ from those that 
are non-HPV-related, in terms 
of epidemiological, clinical, and 
molecular characteristics. HPV-
related cases of oropharyngeal 
cancer have better survival than 
non-HPV-related cases.

●● The main carcinogenic process 
in HPV-related head and neck 
cancers is through the action 
of viral oncoproteins: E6 affects 
p53 and E7 affects retinoblasto-
ma, disrupting these pathways.

●● HPV vaccination is a potential 
tool for prophylaxis of HPV-
related head and neck cancers. 
There are promising new po-
tential screening and monitor-
ing biomarkers, such as HPV16 
E6 serology.

growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), 
epidermal growth factor receptor 1 
(EGFR1), and HER3 (also known as 
ERBB3); (iii) genomically stable tu-
mours (19.7%), which are enriched 
for the diffuse type and mutations 
of CDH1, RHOA, and genes as-
sociated with the cytoskeleton and 
cell junctions; and (iv) tumours with 
chromosomal instability (49.8%), 
which are of the intestinal type and 
show marked aneuploidy, TP53 mu-
tations, and focal amplification of 
RAS and receptor tyrosine kinases. 
The EBV-positive subtype was as-
sociated with the most favourable 
prognosis, followed by the MSI and 
chromosomal instability subtypes.

ACRG reported a similar classi-
fication of gastric cancer and distin-
guished the following four molecular 
subtypes (Fig.  5.4.4): (i)  MSI hyper-
mutated tumours, which are of the 
intestinal type and are mostly local-
ized to the antrum, and microsatellite 
stable (MSS) tumours, subdivided 
into (ii)  those that exhibit features of 
epithelial–mesenchymal transition 
(MSS/EMT), which occur at a youn-
ger age and are mostly of the diffuse 
type; (iii) those that lose p53 activity 
(MSS/TP53−) and show amplification 
of HER2 (ERBB2); and (iv) those with 
wild-type TP53 (MSS/TP53+), which 
are associated with EBV. The MSS/
EMT and MSS/TP53− gastric can-
cers had the poorest survival [23].

Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) molecular classifications. The global 
distribution frequencies of gastric cancer subtypes are indicated as percentages. TCGA subtypes: MSI, microsatellite instability; 
CIN, chromosomal instability; EBV+, positive for Epstein–Barr virus; GS, genomically stable. ACRG subtypes: MSI, microsatellite 
instability; MSS/TP53−, microsatellite stable with inactive TP53; MSS/TP53+, microsatellite stable with active TP53; MSS/EMT,

a Risk factors and protective factors for colorectal adenomas are generally consistent with those identified for colorectal cancer. Also, risk factors and 
protective factors for conventional adenomas and for sessile serrated adenomas generally overlap; the main difference is the higher risk of sessile serrated 
adenoma in women, as opposed to the higher prevalence of conventional adenomas in men [29].
b Evidence grade is based on the classification used in the WCRF/AICR report [27] and, for smoking only, in the IARC Monographs [28].
c Protective effect observed for colon cancer only [30].
d Measured as: active versus sedentary; vigorous or high versus low; < 10 metabolic equivalent (MET) hours/week, or < 1 hour/week, or < 10 minutes per

e Probably as a marker of factors that influence growth in early life.
f Epidemiological studies have consistently shown an inverse association between circulating concentrations of vitamin D and risk of colorectal cancer, 
although findings from recent Mendelian randomization analyses do not necessarily support a causal relationship [31].
g Current smoking was associated with risk of rectal cancer and proximal colorectal cancer, but not of distal colorectal cancer [30].

a Evidence on newer techniques that have emerged recently was deemed insufficient. In particular, only one study was available assessing the accuracy 
of a multitarget stool DNA test combined with the faecal immunochemical test (FIT); it showed an increased sensitivity for sessile serrated adenoma, 
compared with FIT alone. Similarly, only one study has been conducted to assess the accuracy of a blood biomarker (methylated septin 9 DNA); it showed 
a low sensitivity for advanced adenomas.
b Screening trial included people 55 years or older, and current population-based programmes offer screening between age 55 years and age 59 years.

increases the risk of HCC [13].

Hepatocarcinogenesis caused 
by infection with HBV or HCV is a 
multistage process with a multifac-
torial etiology (Fig. 5.6.3). Infection 
with HBV or HCV also causes in-
trahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, at 
a much lower incidence than HCC.

Fig. 5.6.2. In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B, there are milestone transitions of three hepatitis B virus (HBV) seromarkers. 
The serum HBV DNA level (viral load) remains high during the immune tolerance phase. Both HBV e antigen (HBeAg) seroclearance 
and anti-HBe seropositivity occur after a period of elevation of serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a seromarker of liver 
inflammation, during the immune clearance phase. The serum HBV DNA level (viral load) may remain high or may gradually decline 
in patients with HBeAg-seronegative status. Seroclearance of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) may occur after the serum HBV DNA 
level becomes undetectable during the residual phase. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

Fig. 5.6.3. The progression from self-limited hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection through chronic hepatitis 
and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistage pathogenic process driven by the interaction among viral, host, and 
environmental factors. Viral co-factors include viral load and genotype of HBV and HCV. Environmental co-factors for virus-related 
HCC include alcohol consumption, aflatoxin exposure, cigarette smoking, low intake of carotenes and selenium, and others. Host 
co-factors include age, sex, family history of HCC, obesity, serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a seromarker of hepatic 
inflammation), fibrosis score, serum testosterone level, and genetic polymorphisms of metabolism enzymes, oncogenes, tumour 
suppressor genes, hormone-related genes, immunity-related genes, inflammation-related genes, and others. F, female; HBeAg,

patients with chronic hepatitis B. Integer risk scores are assigned to various groups of eight predictors: sex, age, family history of 
HCC, alcohol intake, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, HBV e antigen (HBeAg) serostatus, serum HBV DNA level, and 
HBV genotype. Both 5-year and 10-year risks of HCC by summed risk score are depicted in the nomogram. It is easy to identify the 
long-term HCC risk by summing the risk scores. These nomograms have high internal validity and discriminatory ability to triage 
patients with chronic hepatitis B into different risk groups.

The potential benefit of screen-

demonstrated in a study in Europe, 
which noted that CDKN2A mutation 
carriers were more likely to be di-
agnosed with a resectable pancre-
atic cancer and had a higher 5-year 
survival rate [32]. Recent data from 
the International Cancer of the 
Pancreas Screening Consortium 
showed that 9 of 10 screen-detect-

able, suggesting a benefit of screen-
ing in individuals at high risk [33].

Primary prevention campaigns 
have been running in Australia 
since the 1980s and have focused 
on reducing sun exposure through 
rescheduling outdoor activities, 
seeking shade, using clothing to 
protect the skin, and applying sun-
screen to exposed body sites. There 
is moderately strong evidence from 
controlled trials that sun protection 
including use of sunscreen reduces 
development of naevi and risk of 
melanoma [19,20]. Since 2007, the 
incidence of melanoma has been 
declining overall in Australia, driven 
largely by significant reductions in 
recent birth cohorts, consistent with 
a successful intervention to reduce 
sun exposure [21].

conferred by a large number of genetic variants. Most cutaneous melanomas appear to be initiated by exposure to ultraviolet B 
radiation in early life, which causes mutations in BRAF in melanocytes. Further progression depends on the site of the target cell

sun-exposed sites, particularly the

faces of the limbs. Precancerous 
skin lesions that have similar mor-

keratoses (sunspots), intraepider-

whether these are true precursors

Sequencing studies have iden-

burdens in both BCC and SCC, 
consistent with extensive UV ra-

lists of driver genes differ for BCC 
and SCC. Mutations in genes in 
the hedgehog pathway appear to 
be critical for BCC development,

in BCC. Recurrent mutations have

Table 5.10.5. 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging of cancer of the cervix uteri

Stagea Description
I The carcinoma is strictly confined to the cervix uteri (extension to the corpus should be disregarded)

IA Invasive carcinoma that can be diagnosed only by microscopy, with maximum depth of invasion < 5 mmb

IA1 Measured stromal invasion < 3 mm in depth
IA2 Measured stromal invasion ≥ 3 mm and < 5 mm in depth

IB Invasive carcinoma with measured deepest invasion ≥ 5 mm (greater than stage IA), lesion limited to the cervix uteric

IB1 Invasive carcinoma with ≥ 5 mm depth of stromal invasion and < 2 cm in greatest dimension
IB2 Invasive carcinoma ≥ 2 cm and < 4 cm in greatest dimension
IB3 Invasive carcinoma ≥ 4 cm in greatest dimension

II The carcinoma invades beyond the uterus but has not extended into the lower third of the vagina or to the pelvic wall
IIA Involvement limited to the upper two thirds of the vagina, without parametrial involvement

IIA1 Invasive carcinoma < 4 cm in greatest dimension
IIA2 Invasive carcinoma ≥ 4 cm in greatest dimension

IIB With parametrial involvement but not up to the pelvic wall
III The carcinoma involves the lower third of the vagina and/or extends to the pelvic wall and/or causes hydronephrosis or non-

functioning kidney and/or involves pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodesd

IIIA The carcinoma involves the lower third of the vagina, with no extension to the pelvic wall
IIIB Extension to the pelvic wall and/or hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney (unless known to be due to another cause)
IIIC Involvement of pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes, irrespective of tumour size and extent (with r and p notations)d

IIIC1 Pelvic lymph node metastasis only
IIIC2 Para-aortic lymph node metastasis

IV The carcinoma has extended beyond the true pelvis or has involved (biopsy proven) the mucosa of the bladder or rectum. A 
bullous oedema, as such, does not permit a case to be allotted to stage IV

IVA Spread of the growth to adjacent organs
IVB Spread to distant organs

a When in doubt, the lower staging should be assigned.
b Imaging and pathology can be used, when available, to supplement clinical findings with respect to tumour size and extent, in all stages.
c The involvement of vascular/lymphatic spaces does not change the staging. The lateral extent of the lesion is no longer considered.
d Adding notation of r (imaging) and p (pathology) to indicate the findings that are used to allocate the case to stage IIIC. For example, if imaging indicates 
pelvic lymph node metastasis, the stage allocation would be stage IIIC1r, and if confirmed by pathological findings, it would be stage IIIC1p. The type of 
imaging modality or pathology technique used should always be documented. When in doubt, the lower staging should be assigned.

would lead to the development of 
thyroid cancer [30].

In recent years, it has been sug-
gested that environmental and die-
tary exposure to nitrites may contrib-
ute to the development of papillary 
thyroid cancer [31,32].

Hereditability
Several inherited conditions with 
known genetic causes are associ-
ated with increased risk of thyroid 
cancer of different cellular origins 
[33]. Medullary thyroid cancer can 
occur as a result of a germline ac-
tivating mutation in the RET onco-
gene. In children, medullary thyroid 
cancer is most commonly associ-
ated with the MEN type 2 (MEN2) 
syndrome. Increased risks of dif-
ferentiated thyroid cancer are seen 
in people with PTEN hamartoma 

with more extensive local invasion, In observational studies, over- tumour syndrome (Cowden syn-
drome), DICER1 pleuropulmonary

Exposure to medical radiation 
has increased in children, and this 
may also contribute to the develop-
ment of thyroid cancer [28].

Other factors
In geographical areas where the 
population has a low dietary intake 
of stable iodine, there is a higher 
incidence of goitre, follicular thyroid 
cancer, and possibly anaplastic thy-
roid cancer. Iodine excess has been 
proposed as a cause of increased 
risk of papillary thyroid cancer, but 
no plausible mechanism has been 
identified [29].

Etiology and biological 
characteristics
Lymphomas arise from clonal tu-
mours of B cells, T cells, or NK 
cells (Fig.  5.19.4) that have ar-
rested during different stages of 
differentiation. Emerging evidence 
indicates that the etiology of NHL 
is complex, with subtype-specific 
patterns of risk [14].

Known or suspected risk factors 
include immune alterations (e.g. im-
munosuppression), viral infections 
(e.g. hepatitis C virus [HCV] and hu-
man T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 
[HTLV-1]), autoimmune diseases

agents such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons should be pursued. 
In addition, radiological diagnostic 
and therapeutic procedures involv-
ing ionizing radiation should be 
used only when clinically required, 
and at the lowest possible doses.

With respect to the potential 
impact on high-risk groups, more 
careful monitoring of individuals 
with recognized leukaemia predis-
position syndromes or other genetic 
susceptibilities is one area where 
improvements could be made. For 
example, the onset of bone mar-
row failure, a prelude to AML, could 
perhaps be detected at an earlier 
stage, enabling pre-emptive hae-
matopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tion to be undertaken.

However, in situations where 
primary prevention is not possible, 
early detection and improved treat-
ments tend to be the major focus. 
In this respect, the landscape for 
the leukaemias is changing rapidly, 
with new diagnostic technologies 
and less toxic targeted novel agents 
emerging, providing considerable 
promise for the future.

consultation and/or interaction with a physician or health-care 
worker.

Quitlines A national toll-free quitline is a telephone counselling service that 
can provide both proactive and reactive counselling. A reactive 
quitline provides an immediate response to a call initiated by the 
tobacco user, but only responds to incoming calls. A proactive 
quitline involves setting up a schedule of follow-up calls to tobacco 
users to provide ongoing support.

mCessation Tobacco cessation interventions are delivered via mobile phone 
text messaging. Mobile technologies provide the opportunity to 
expand access to a wider population, and text messaging can 
provide personalized tobacco cessation support in an efficient and 
cost-effective manner.

Individual specialist Intensive behavioural Behaviour support refers to multiple sessions of individual or 
approaches support group counselling aimed at helping people stop their tobacco use. 

It includes all cessation assistance that imparts knowledge about 
tobacco use and quitting, and provides support and resources to 
develop skills and strategies for changing behaviour.

Cessation clinics In many countries, clinics specializing in tobacco cessation 
services are available. These clinics offer intensive behavioural 
support and, where appropriate, medications or advice on 
the provision of medications, delivered by specially trained 
practitioners.

Pharmacological Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) NRTs are available in several forms, including gum, lozenges, 
interventions patches, inhalers, and nasal spray. These cessation tools reduce 

cravings and withdrawal symptoms by providing a low, controlled 
dose of nicotine without the toxins found in cigarettes. The doses 
of NRT are gradually reduced over time to help the tobacco user 
wean off nicotine by getting used to less and less stimulation.

Non-nicotine pharmacotherapies These include medications such as bupropion, varenicline, 
and cytisine. These pharmacotherapies reduce cravings and 
withdrawal symptoms and decrease the pleasurable effects of 
cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Table P1.3. Questions and summaries of the evidence for heated tobacco products (HTPs)

Question Summary of the evidence
Do HTPs contain harmful chemicals? From available evidence, we know that many of the harmful chemicals that are generated by 

HTPs are similar to those generated by conventional cigarettes, but generally at lower levels 
[46,47]. However, there is also some evidence that there are new chemicals in HTPs that are not 
present in the emissions of conventional cigarettes, and that could have some degree of toxicity 
and associated harm [24].

Are HTPs less harmful than cigarettes? To date, the available evidence demonstrates that exposure to harmful and potentially harmful 
chemicals from these products may be lower relative to cigarettes [48] (but higher compared 
with electronic nicotine delivery systems [ENDS]). However, the evidence does not show that 
these products will reduce tobacco-related diseases, or that they are exclusively used as 
substitutes for cigarettes. If they attract users who were not previously tobacco users, their 
overall impact on health would be negative.

Are HTPs useful as a cessation aid? HTPs are tobacco products and, therefore, even if a tobacco user converts from the use of 
conventional cigarettes to HTPs, this would not constitute cessation. Claims that smokers 
switch from conventional cigarettes to exclusive use of HTPs are unsubstantiated [49]. Further 
independent studies are needed to gather more information and inform policy options.

Table P1.4. Questions and summaries of the evidence for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)

Question Summary of the evidence
What are the consequences of taking Recent surveys in the USA and some European countries have shown marked increases in 
up ENDS use at a younger age? ENDS use among young people [50]. Between 2011 and 2018 in the USA, rates of e-cigarette 

use in young people increased from 1.5% to a staggering 20.8% [44]. Young people who use 
ENDS are exposed to nicotine, which can have long-term effects on the developing brain, and 
there is a risk of nicotine addiction, given that tobacco product use is primarily established in 
adolescence [37]. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence in some settings that never-
smoker minors who use ENDS at least double their chance of starting to smoke cigarettes later 
in life [51,52].

What is the harm of ENDS relative to ENDS’ aerosols are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes, but there is insufficient evidence 
conventional cigarettes? to quantify the precise level of risk associated with them [39]. Also, many factors will have an 

impact on the relative risk associated with their use, for example the amount of nicotine and 
other toxicants in the heated liquid.

What are the health effects associated ENDS pose risks to users and non-users [39]. There is insufficient evidence to quantify this risk, 
with ENDS? and the long-term effects of exposure to ENDS’ toxic emissions are unknown [39,50]. In addition 

to risks associated with emissions of ENDS, there are also risks of physical injury brought about 
by fires or explosions related to ENDS devices [53].

Do ENDS help smokers quit tobacco? The effectiveness of ENDS as a smoking cessation aid is still being debated. To date, in part 
due to the diversity of ENDS products and the low certainty surrounding many studies, the 
potential for ENDS to play a role as a population-level tobacco cessation intervention is unclear 
[28–30].

Box P1.1. Excerpt on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) from the WHO Director-General’s Commentary in The Lancet [54].

Much has been written and said about the potential of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as 
e-cigarettes to help tobacco users quit [31,36–38]. Although tobacco and related industries promote these 
products as tools for quitting, the evidence does not support their use as part of population-based cessation 
strategies. The aerosols of ENDS contain toxic chemicals that are harmful to both users and non-users and 
are, therefore, products that come with health risks of their own [31,39]. And in combination with smoking, 
which is the practice with the majority of ENDS users, the health effects of two or more products are combined 
[35]. ENDS on their own are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases [40] and lung disorders 
[41] and adverse effects on the development of the fetus during pregnancy [37]. For adolescents, the addictive 
nature of nicotine can lead to dependence and may harm adolescent brain development, including reduced ac-
tivity in the prefrontal cortex [42,43]. Use of ENDS could also lead to a new generation of nicotine and tobacco 
users, as seen in some countries [44], especially given how these products are marketed to young people [37]. 
Although the specific level of risk associated with ENDS has not yet been conclusively estimated, ENDS are 
undoubtedly harmful, should be strictly regulated, and, most importantly, must be kept away from children. It is 
also incorrect to think that heated tobacco products are the answer, as they simply move tobacco users from 
one harmful tobacco product to another.

To truly help tobacco users quit and to strengthen global tobacco control, governments need to scale up 
policies and interventions that we know work. Tried and tested interventions, such as nicotine and non-nicotine 
pharmacotherapies, should be promoted for cessation.

Tobacco cessation: the WHO perspective 495



Box P1.2. Summary on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) and 
cessation, from the seventh report of the WHO Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation [45].

ENDS are a heterogeneous class of products, with various profiles of nicotine and non-nicotine toxicants, 
which depend on factors including their construction, power, liquid constituents, nicotine concentration, and 
user behaviour. The amount of nicotine delivered can range from none to doses that exceed those delivered 
by tobacco cigarettes in the same number of puffs. Nicotine from ENDS reaches users’ blood faster than from 
most types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and, at least with some ENDS, at higher concentrations. 
ENDS could be effective in cessation for some smokers under some circumstances, while, for other smokers, 
in different circumstances, it might have the opposite effect. Whether an ENDS has beneficial or detrimental 
effects on smoking cessation appears to depend on the technology, the motivation and consumer behaviour 
of the ENDS user, the type of smoker who seeks ENDS use, and the regulatory environment for ENDS and 
tobacco use.

Translating the evidence into a potential role of ENDS and ENNDS in smoking cessation is difficult. The 
evidence does not allow a blanket policy recommendation for or against general use of ENDS and ENNDS as 
cessation aids.

likelihood of successful programmes 
and policies being implemented, 
greater workforce productivity, and 
more efficient use of public and pri-
vate resources [30].

Despite the gold standard pro-
vided by timely implementation of 
these evidence-based interven-
tions, much less attention has been 
focused on how to effectively imple-
ment these practices [30]. A useful 
framework ties the evidence-based 
strategies to implementation sci-
ence for effective uptake, dissemi-
nation, and scale-up. The context 
for the preventive interventions (e.g. 
public health or clinical systems, 
regulatory strategies, or community- 
or group-based interventions, such 
as in the workplace, at schools, and 
at childcare centres) must be con-
sidered when identifying strategies 
for implementation [31].

In addition to the characteristics 
of the intervention, the capacity of the 
public health infrastructure and the 
health delivery system to implement 
and sustain a prevention strategy is 
fundamental to the success of the in-
tervention. In the setting of tobacco 
control, partners of WHO assess 
the commitment and organizational 
structure for implementing evidence-
based tobacco control programmes. 
For other interventions, including 
vaccination programmes, the un-
derlying structure of health systems 
and the goals of access to universal 
health coverage are integral to the 
programme’s success. Universal ac- egies. For example, national cam- Australia has led the world with

text, and the study of this process 
shows promise to inform broader 
prevention goals. Specifically, inter-
ventions that address children’s nu-
trition, physical activity, and energy 
balance can be adapted to diverse 
school settings and student popula-
tions to align with local relevance 
and account for the norms and cul-
ture within schools [36]. Similarly, 
the components of programmes 
that lead to sustainability are now 
considered within frameworks that 
may help to bring prevention to 
broader populations [37].

Public health capacity is a key 
variable that underpins the suc-
cessful implementation of pro-
grammes. When evaluating and 
implementing a programme, cues 
can be taken from other strategies 
that have proven effective in build-
ing capacity [38].

Finally, approaches to measur-
ing and evaluating the success of 
interventions (and their component 
parts) must be defined and as-
sessed within the constraints of re-
al-world delivery. Using appropriate 
measures in the context of imple-
mentation models bring a sharper 
focus to quantification of the impact 
of programmes [30].

Health behavioural interventions, 
such as prevention, should follow the 
dimensions of the RE-AIM framework 
(i.e. reach, efficacy, adoption, imple-
mentation, and maintenance). To 
ensure that preventive interventions 
are effective, a focus must be placed 
on the maintenance and sustainabil-
ity of the intervention. Furthermore,

Hawkes et al. [6] described four 
mechanisms through which food 
policies can have an impact on diet 
throughout the life-course: (i)  pro-
viding an enabling environment for 
the learning of healthy preferences 
in childhood (because preferences 
are often persistent and resis-

[14]. Opportunities to provide warning 
labels related to cancer are consid-
ered to be a useful avenue to raise 
awareness of cancer risk, although 
such approaches are not supported 
by the alcohol industry.

At the individual level, opportunis-
tic screening (assessment of alcohol 
consumption) in primary care and 
other health-care settings, followed 
by brief interventions, is an effective 
approach, which has been demon-
strated to have a moderate effect 
on reducing alcohol consumption 
and increasing the number of people 
drinking alcohol below levels associ-
ated with increased risk. Brief inter-
ventions with multiple contacts or 
follow-up sessions appear to be the 
most effective [15].

Sedentary behaviour
Research on changing sedentary 
behaviour (i.e. time spent sitting) in 
the workplace, during leisure time, 
commuting, and in the household is 
relatively recent (see Chapter 2.7). 
Several reviews have highlighted 
that interventions that target both 
physical activity and sedentary be-
haviour are generally ineffective 
in changing time spent sitting [19]. 
This finding underlines the impor-
tance of an intervention having a 
primary aim of reducing sedentary 
behaviour; otherwise, effects on 
this outcome tend to be small.

(HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 
56, 58, 59, and probably 68). Types 
HPV16 and HPV18 are detectable in 
about 70% of cervical cancers, with 
little variation around the world [17].

Substantial fractions of other 
cancer types, including cancers of 
the anus (88%), vulva and vagina 
(41%), penis (50%), and oropharynx 
(30%), are also attributable to HPV,

shows an assumption of a 15-year transition period. The arrows show the approximate timing of the introduction of vaccination, 
before or after the transition. Traditional sexual behaviour indicates a population in which genders have different age-specific sexual 
activity rates and a wide gap in ages (e.g. an average of 5.6 years, as observed in India) of spouses or cohabitating sexual partners. 
Gender-similar sexual behaviour indicates a population in which genders have similar age-specific sexual activity rates and a 
narrow gap in ages (e.g. an average of 2.1 years, as observed in the USA) of spouses or cohabitating sexual partners.

Fig. 6.6.1. Models of clonal evolution and tumour progression. The relationship between models of carcinogenesis (clonal evolution 
with tumours shown in black), tumour progression through clinical stages, and progression time with regard to early detection by 
screening. A linear evolution of carcinogenesis (A) is more plausible in tumours that have a long sojourn time, progressively transit 
through clinical stages, and are detectable by screening. However, some tumours that are due to this pattern may have a slow 
growth rate (even regression) and would not be detected by screening (indolent tumours, shown by the dotted lines). In tumours 
with branched evolution (B), clones derive from a common ancestor but evolve in parallel. Such tumours may have more rapid pro-
gression, but the sojourn time is still long enough to enable their detection by screening. Some tumours have punctuated evolution 
(C), with a large number of mutations in short periods and one or two clones progressing rapidly. Therefore, they are more difficult 
to detect by screening (interval cancers).

Population-based programmes are 
considered to be essential for suc-
cessful cancer screening (Box 6.6.1). 
The main effects expected from such 
programmes are increased cover-
age, improved cost–effectiveness, 
and improved equity. Early studies 
in Europe showed an inverse rela-
tionship between screening cover-
age and cervical cancer incidence 
and mortality [29]. However, this 
relationship is less clear in regions

Occupational exposures 
to chemical, physical, and 
biological agents
Worldwide, an estimated 740 000 
people per year die from exposure 
to carcinogens in the workplace [11] 
(see Chapter 2.10). Many such can-
cers occur in high-income countries, 
because of longer life expectancies. 
However, exposures can be higher 
in low- and middle-income countries 
if there is low compliance with safety 
norms, if there is weak enforcement 
of hazard control in workplaces, if 
worker organizations are not strong 
enough to ensure compliance with 
standards, and/or if there is a large 
informal economy that is not subject 
to regular inspection [12].

South Africa, tripling the price of cig-
arettes halved cigarette consumption 
in less than 15  years and doubled 
tobacco revenues to the state, which 
could be used to fund other smoking-
reduction activities, such as advertis-

[18].

Worldwide, the age-standard-
ized prevalence of daily smok-
ing in 2016 was estimated to be 
25% in men and 5.4% in women 
[19]. Between 1990 and 2015, the 
global age-standardized preva-
lence decreased by 28% in men 
and by 34% in women; there was 
substantial heterogeneity across 
countries both in smoking preva-
lence and in change in prevalence 
[19]. Implementation of the WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control, called for in Target 3a of 
the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, is still patchy, 
and a greatly decreased prevalence 
of smoking will be required to coun-
ter the demographic effects of an 
increase in the younger age groups 
that the tobacco industry targets to 
become new smokers. Increasing 
the quit rates among current smok-
ers is also critical. Another part of

World Cancer Report
Cancer research for cancer prevention 

Cancer is the second most common cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. 
The 2017 World Health Assembly requested WHO, in collaboration with IARC, to provide a global perspective on 
all measures that are recognized to limit the burden of cancer. The outcome of this charge – the WHO Report on 
Cancer: Setting priorities, investing wisely and providing care for all – complements the IARC World Cancer Report 
by synthesizing evidence to translate the latest knowledge into actionable policies to support governments.

— Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, WHO

In 2014, World Cancer Report established that it is implausible to treat our way out of the coming cancer burden: 
prevention is the only option. Accordingly, this new World Cancer Report is totally focused on prevention, and it 
is the most comprehensive overview of relevant research currently available.

— Dr Christopher P. Wild, IARC Director 2009–2018

This new World Cancer Report provides investigators with detailed information across a multidisciplinary spec-
trum. Equally, World Cancer Report provides people in the wider community, no matter where they are located 
worldwide, with insights into how the cancer types that have for so long affected their communities may now have 
a lesser impact than was previously thought.

— Dr Elisabete Weiderpass, Director, IARC

“Cancer research for cancer prevention” is not simply a way to describe a particular field of investigation. Far 
more importantly, these words identify a pathway that may materially reduce the acknowledged burden of cancer 
faced by humanity. There is, in fact, no other way.

— Professor Bernard W. Stewart, University of New South Wales, Sydney

Highlights of this World Cancer Report include:
•	 Although excess body fatness increases the risk of cancers at various organ sites, including the colon and 

rectum, the risk may be reduced by intentional weight loss.
•	 Cancer-causing pollution of air and water are amenable to intervention by technological and regulatory means.
•	 Cervical cancer may be eliminated as a public health problem by vaccination against human papillomavirus 

(HPV) infection, even in low-income countries where cervical cancer is the major cancer type.
•	 In most countries, socioeconomic disparities limit the impact of proven preventive interventions.
•	 Individual susceptibility to particular cancers is increasingly understood from molecular technology.
