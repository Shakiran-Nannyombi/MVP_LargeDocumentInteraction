From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in Pride and Prejudice  
1813. The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as
she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education
and marriage in the landed gentry society of early 19th-century
England. Elizabeth is the second eldest of five daughters of a
country gentleman landed in the fictional town of Meryton in
Hertfordshire, near London.

Though the story's setting is characteristically turn-of-the-19th-
century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing
near the top of lists of 'most loved books' such as The Big Read. It
has become one of the most popular novels in English literature,
and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern
interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic
adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating
Austen's memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has
sold some 20 million copies worldwide.[1]

The main plot of the novel is driven by a particular situation of the Bennet family: if Mr. Bennet dies soon, his
wife and five daughters will be without home or income, as the Longbourn estate is entailed to one of Mr.
Bennet's collateral relatives—male only in this case—by the legal terms of fee tail. Mrs Bennet worries about
this predicament, and wishes to find husbands for her daughters quickly. The father doesn't seem to be worried at
all.

The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy young gentleman and a very eligible bachelor, renting a country
estate near the Bennets called Netherfield. He arrives accompanied by his fashionable sisters and his good friend,
Mr Darcy. Attending the local assembly (dance) Bingley is well received in the community, while Darcy begins
his acquaintance with smug condescension and 'proud' distaste for all the country locals. After Darcy's haughty
rejection of her at the dance, Elizabeth resolves to match his coldness and pride, his prejudice against country
people, with her own prideful anger—in biting wit and sometimes sarcastic remarks—directed towards him.
(Elizabeth's disposition leads her into prejudices regarding Darcy and others, such that she is unable to 'sketch'
their characters accurately.)

Soon, Bingley and Jane begin to grow close. Elizabeth's best friend, Charlotte, advises that Jane should show her
affection to Bingley more openly, as he may not realise that she is indeed interested in him. Elizabeth flippantly
dismisses the opinion—replying that Jane is shy and modest, and that if Bingley can't see how she feels, he is a
simpleton—and she doesn't tell Jane of Charlotte's warning. Later Elizabeth begins a friendship with Mr
Wickham, a militia officer who is of long personal acquaintance with Darcy—they grew up together. Wickham
tells her he has been seriously mistreated by the proud man; Elizabeth seizes on this news as further reason to
dislike Darcy. Ironically, Darcy begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth, unbeknownst to her.

Mr Collins, the male relative who is to inherit Longbourn, makes an appearance and stays with the Bennets.
Recently ordained a clergyman, he is employed as parish rector by the wealthy and patronising Lady Catherine
de Bourgh of Kent. Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are amused by his self-important and pedantic behaviour. Though
his stated reason for visiting is to reconcile with the Bennets, Collins soon confides to Mrs Bennet that he wishes
to find a wife from among the Bennet sisters. He first offers to pursue Jane; however, Mrs Bennet mentions that
her eldest daughter is soon likely to be engaged, and redirects his attentions to Elizabeth.

At a ball given by Bingley at Netherfield, Elizabeth intends to deepen her acquaintance with Mr Wickham, who,
however, fails to appear. She is asked to dance by Mr Darcy; here she raises Wickham's fate with him, causing
their harmonious dance to fall into a 'testy' discussion. The ball proceeds as spectacle: the arriviste Sir William
Lucas shocks Darcy, alluding to Jane and Bingley and 'a certain desirable event'; Mr. Collins behaves fatuously;
now Mrs Bennet talks loudly and indiscreetly of her expectation of marriage between Jane and Bingley, and, in
general, cousin Collins and the Bennet family—save Jane and Elizabeth—combine in a public display of poor
manners and upbringing that clearly disgusts Darcy and embarrasses Elizabeth

The next morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress.
Collins handily recovers and, within three days, proposes to Elizabeth's close friend, Charlotte Lucas, who
immediately accepts. Once marriage arrangements are settled, Charlotte persuades Elizabeth to come for an
extended visit to her new bridal home.

Though appearing at the point of proposing marriage to Jane, Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns
to London, leaving the lady confused and upset. Elizabeth is convinced that Darcy and Bingley's sister have
conspired to separate Jane and Bingley.

In the spring, Elizabeth joins Charlotte and her cousin in Kent. The parsonage is adjacent to Rosings Park—the
grand manor of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr Darcy's aunt—where Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently
invited to socialize. After Mr Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam arrive to visit Lady Catherine, Elizabeth
renews her project of teasing Darcy—while his admiration for her grows in spite of his intentions otherwise. Now
Elizabeth learns from Fitzwilliam that Darcy prides himself on having separated Bingley from Jane; and, with the
poorest of timing, Darcy chooses this moment to admit his love for Elizabeth, and he proposes to her. Incensed
by his high-handed and insulting manner, she abruptly refuses him. When he asks why—so uncivil her reply—
Elizabeth confronts him with his sabotage of Jane and Bingley's budding relationship and with Wickham's
account of Darcy's mistreatment of him, among other complaints.

Deeply shaken by Elizabeth's vehemence and accusations, Darcy writes her a letter which reveals the true
history between Wickham and himself. Wickham had renounced his legacy—a clergyman's 'living' in Darcy's
patronage—for a cash payment; only to return after gambling away the money to again claim the position . After
Darcy refused Wickham attempted to elope with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister Georgiana, and thereby secure
her part of the Darcy family fortune. He was found out and stopped only a day before the intended elopement.
Regarding Bingley and Jane, Darcy justifies his interference: he had observed in Jane no reciprocal interest for
Bingley; thus he aimed to separate them to protect his friend from heartache.

In the letter Darcy admits his 'repugnance' for the 'total want of propriety' of her (Elizabeth's) family, especially
her mother and three younger sisters. After reading the letter, Elizabeth begins to question both her family's
behaviour and Wickham's credibility. She also concludes: Wickham is not as trustworthy as his easy manners
would indicate; that he had lied to her previously; and that her early impressions of Darcy's character might not
have been accurate. Soon, Elizabeth returns home.

Some months later, during a 'northern' tour, Elizabeth and her Aunt and
Uncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, while he's away. The elderly
housekeeper has known Darcy since childhood, and presents a flattering and
benevolent impression of his character to Elizabeth and the Gardiners. As
they tour the grounds Darcy unexpectedly returns home. Though
shocked—as is Elizabeth—he makes an obvious effort to be gracious and
welcoming, and treats the Gardiners—whom before he would have dismissed
as socially inferior—with remarkable politeness. Later he introduces
Elizabeth to his sister, a high compliment to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is surprised
and hopeful of a possible new beginning with Darcy.

Elizabeth and Darcy's renewed acquaintance is cut short by news that Lydia,
the youngest sister, has run away with Wickham. Initially, the family
(wishfully) believe they have eloped, but they soon learn that Wickham has
no plans to marry Lydia. Lydia's antics threaten her family—especially the
remaining Bennet sisters—with social ruin. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle
hurriedly leave for home; Elizabeth is anguished, and convinced that Darcy
will avoid her from now on.

Soon, thanks apparently to Elizabeth's uncle, Lydia and Wickham are found Elizabeth tells her father that

the new Mrs Darcy; Jane and Bingley eventually move to locate near the Darcys in Derbyshire. Elizabeth and
Jane teach Kitty better social graces, and Mary learns to mix more with the outside world at Meryton. Lydia and
Wickham continue to move often, leaving debts for Jane and Elizabeth to pay. At Pemberley, Elizabeth and
Georgiana grow close; Georgiana is surprised by Elizabeth's playful treatment of Darcy, and she grows more
comfortable with her brother. Lady Catherine holds out, indignant and abusive, over her nephew's marriage, but
eventually Darcy is prevailed upon to reconcile with her sufficiently that she condescends to visit. Elizabeth and
Darcy remain close to her Uncle and Aunt Gardiner—the agents of their reconciling and uniting.

and is susceptible to attacks of tremors and
  

palpitations. Her public manners and social    

climbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth.
Her favourite daughter is the youngest, Lydia.

Jane Bennet is the eldest Bennet sister. Twenty-two years old when
the novel begins, she is considered the most beautiful young lady in
the neighbourhood. Her character is contrasted with Elizabeth's as
sweeter, shyer, and equally sensible, but not as clever; her most
notable trait is a desire to see only the good in others. Jane is closest to
Elizabeth, and her character is often contrasted with that of Elizabeth.

Mary Bennet is the only plain Bennet sister, and rather than join in
some of the family activities, she reads, although is often impatient for
display. She works hard for knowledge and accomplishment, but has
neither genius nor taste. At the ball at Netherfield, she embarrasses her
family by singing badly.

Catherine "Kitty" Bennet is the fourth Bennet sister, aged
seventeen. She is portrayed as a less headstrong but equally silly
shadow of Lydia.

Lydia Bennet is the youngest Bennet sister, aged fifteen when the
novel begins. She is repeatedly described as frivolous and headstrong.
Her main activity in life is socialising, especially flirting with the
military officers stationed in the nearby town of Meryton. She Lady Catherine confronts

Charles Bingley is a young gentleman without an estate. His wealth
was recent, and he is seeking a permanent home. He rents the Netherfield estate near Longbourn when the
novel opens. Twenty-two years old at the start of the novel, charismatic, handsome, good-natured, and
wealthy, he is contrasted with his friend Darcy as being less intelligent but kinder and more charming and
hence more popular in Meryton. He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others.

Caroline Bingley is the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley. Clearly harbouring romantic intentions on
Darcy herself, she views his growing attachment to Elizabeth Bennet with some jealousy, resulting in
disdain and frequent verbal attempts to undermine Elizabeth and her society.

George Wickham is an old acquaintance of Darcy from childhood, and an officer in the militia unit
stationed near Meryton. Superficially charming, he rapidly forms a friendship with Elizabeth Bennet,
prompting remarks upon his suitability as a potential husband. He spreads numerous tales about the wrongs
Darcy has done to him, colouring the popular perception of the other man in local society. It is eventually
revealed that these tales are distortions, and that Darcy was the wronged man in their acquaintance.

William Collins, aged twenty-five, is Mr Bennet's clergyman cousin and, as Mr Bennet has no son, heir to
his estate. Austen described him as "not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little
assisted by education or society." Collins boasts of his acquaintance with — and advantageous patronage
from — Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Mr Bennet, Jane, and Elizabeth consider him pompous and lacking in

common sense. Elizabeth's rejection of Collins' marriage proposal is welcomed by her father, regardless of
the financial benefit to the family of such a match. Elizabeth is later somewhat distressed — although
understanding — when her closest friend, Charlotte Lucas, consents to marry Collins out of her need for a
settled position and to avoid the low status and lack of autonomy of an old maid.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who has wealth and social standing, is haughty, domineering and
condescending. Mr Collins, among others, enables these characteristics by deferring to her opinions and
desires. Elizabeth, however, is duly respectful but not intimidated. Darcy, whilst respectful of their shared
family connection, is offended by her lack of manners, especially towards Elizabeth, and later — when
pressed by her demand that he not marry Elizabeth — is quick to assert his intentions to marry whom he
wishes.

Aunt and Uncle Gardiner: he is Mrs Bennet's brother, and a successful businessman in London—quite
sensible and gentleman-like. His wife is close with—a mentor to—both Elizabeth and Jane, and she proves
vital in assisting Elizabeth and in interpreting Darcy. Jane stays with the Gardiners in London for a while,
and Elizabeth travels with them to Derbyshire, where she again meets Darcy. They both support the
Bennets by trying to help Lydia when she elopes with Wickham.

Georgiana Darcy is Mr Darcy's quiet and amiable younger sister, aged sixteen when the story begins. In a
letter to Elizabeth, Darcy describes events of the previous year, when Wickham tried to persuade
Georgiana to elope with him, so that he could inherit her £30,000. Later, Elizabeth meets her at
Pemberley, where she is amiable and sweet. She is very happy with her brother's choosing of Elizabeth and
maintains a close relationship with them both.

A comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in Pride and Prejudice

Many critics take the novel's title as a starting point when analysing the major themes of Pride and Prejudice;
however, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title since commercial factors may have played
a role in its selection. "After the success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than
to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title. It
should be pointed out that the qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the
protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice."[4]

A major theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing on the development of
young people's character and morality.[5] Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world,
and a further theme common to Jane Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of
Mr and Mrs Bennet (particularly the latter) as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment; Darcy, on
the other hand, has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable, but is also proud and
overbearing.[5] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they
marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[6]

Pride and Prejudice, like most of Jane Austen's works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech.

7 of 12 12/1/2010 3:16 PM



Pride and Prejudice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice

This has been defined as "the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words
actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would
think or speak, if she thought or spoke".[3] By using narrative which adopts the tone and vocabulary of a
particular character (in this case, that of Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's
viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. "The learning curve, while undergone by both
protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ...
for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions."[3]

Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in
Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[7] The novel was
originally titled First Impressions by Jane Austen, and was written
between October 1796 and August 1797.[8] On 1 November 1797
Austen's father gave the draft to London bookseller Thomas Cadell in
hopes of it being published, but it was rejected.[9] The unpublished
manuscript was returned to Austen and it stayed with her.

Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First
Impressions between 1811 and 1812.[8] She later renamed the story
Pride and Prejudice. In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in
mind the "sufferings and oppositions" summarized in the final chapter Modern paperback editions of Pride
of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called "Pride and Prejudice", where the and Prejudice
phrase appears three times in block capitals.[5] It is possible that the
novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of
First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that
name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.[9]

Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton of Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked
for £150).[10] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis,
whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's
commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her £140,[9] she passed the
copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus
has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.[11]

Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three hardcover volumes in January 1813, priced at
18s.[8] Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in November that year. A
third edition was published in 1817.[10]

Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in
German, Danish and Swedish.[12] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United States in August 1832 as
Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.[10] The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel
series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become
the standard edition from which many modern publications of the novel are based.[10]

The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication.[11] Jan
Fergus calls it "her most popular novel, both with the public and with her family and friends",[11] and quotes
David Gilson's A Bibliography of Jane Austen (Clarendon, 1982), where it is stated that Pride and Prejudice
was referred to as "the fashionable novel" by Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron.
However, others did not agree. Charlotte Brontë wrote to noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes after
reading a review of his published in Fraser's Magazine in 1847. He had praised Jane Austen's work and declared
that he, "... would rather have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the Waverley Novels".[13]

Miss Brontë, though, found Pride and Prejudice a disappointment, "... a carefully fenced, highly cultivated
garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny
beck."[13]

Modern popularity

In 2003 the BBC conducted the largest ever poll for the "UK's Best-Loved Book" in which Pride and
Prejudice came second, behind The Lord of the Rings.[14]
In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and Prejudice came first in a list of the
101 best books ever written.[15]

Film, television, and theatre

Pride and Prejudice has engendered numerous adaptations. Some of the notable film versions include that of
1940 starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier,[16] and that of 2005 starring Keira Knightley (in an Oscar-
nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.[17] Notable television versions include two by the BBC: the
popular 1995 version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and
David Rintoul. A 1936 stage version was created by Helen Jerome played at the St. James's Theatre in London,
starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. First Impressions was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring
Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold.[18] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by
Bernard J. Taylor, with Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy and Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet.[19]

A new stage production, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in concert on 21
October 2008 in Rochester, New York with Colin Donnell as Darcy.[20]

Bride and Prejudice, starring Aishwarya Rai, is a Bollywood adaptation of the novel; while Pride & Prejudice:
A Latter-Day Comedy (2003), starring Kam Heskin and Orlando Seale, places the novel at a Mormon university
in modern times.[21][22] Bridget Jones's Diary is a loose adaptation of the novel in a modern setting, starring
Renee Zellweger as a modern-day Elizabeth, and Colin Firth once again as Mr Darcy. The off-Broadway musical
I Love You Because reverses the gender of the main roles, set in modern day New York City. The Japanese comic
Hana Yori Dango by Yoko Kamio, in which the wealthy, arrogant and proud protagonist, Doumyouji Tsukasa,
falls in love with a poor, lower-class girl named Makino Tsukushi, is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice. A
2008 Israeli television six-part miniseries set the story in the Galilee with Mr Darcy a well-paid worker in the
high-tech industry.[23]

Pride and Prejudice has also crossed into the science fiction and horror genres. In the 1997 episode of science

Literature

Main article: List of literary adaptations of Pride and Prejudice

The novel has inspired a number of other works that are not direct adaptations. Books inspired by Pride and
Prejudice include: Mr. Darcy's Daughters and The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy by Elizabeth
Aston; Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued and An Unequal Marriage: Or Pride and Prejudice
Twenty Years Later by Emma Tennant; The Book of Ruth (ASIN B00262ZRBM) by Helen Baker; Jane Austen
Ruined My Life and Mr. Darcy Broke My Heart by Beth Pattillo; Precipitation - A Continuation of Miss Jane
Austen's Pride and Prejudice by Helen Baker; Searching for Pemberley by Mary Simonsen and Mr. Darcy
Takes a Wife and its sequel Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberly by Linda Berdoll.

In Gwyn Cready's comedic romance novel, Seducing Mr. Darcy, the heroine lands in Pride and Prejudice by
way of magic massage, has a fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story.

Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding, which started as a newspaper column before becoming a novel and a
film, was inspired by the then-current BBC adaptation; both works share a Mr. Darcy of serious disposition (both
played by Colin Firth), a foolish match-making mother, and a detached affectionate father, as well as the
protagonist overhearing Mr. Darcy speaking about her disparagingly, followed by the caddish character gaining
the protagonist's affections by telling lies about Mr. Darcy. The self-referential in-jokes continue with the sequel,
Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.

In March 2009, Quirk Books released Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which takes Austen's actual, original
work, and mashes it up with zombie hordes, cannibalism, ninjas, and ultra-violent mayhem.[25] In March 2010,
Quirk Books published a prequel which deals with Elizabeth Bennett's early days as a zombie hunter, entitled
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls.[26]

Marvel has also published their take on this classic, releasing a short comic series of five issues that stays true to
the original storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was written by Nancy Hajeski.[27]

Pamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story of Pride and Prejudice from Mr. Darcy's point of
view entitled Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman. The books are An Assemby Such as This, Duty and Desire and
These Three Remain. [28]
